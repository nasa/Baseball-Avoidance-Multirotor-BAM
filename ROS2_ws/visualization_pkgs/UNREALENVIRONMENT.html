<p>Airsim works as a plugin within Unreal Applications, and is provided
as source or dated binaries. It is recommended to pull the source from
the website and build directly. Information on this can be found on the
website.</p>
<p>Airsim has been archived by Microsoft, so to use it with newer
versions of Unreal (5+), Colosseum must be used (a fork development of
airsim). - For Unreal 4: Airsim can be found here:
https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/ - For Unreal 5: Colosseum can be
found here: https://github.com/CodexLabsLLC/Colosseum</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-unreal-environment">Creating An Unreal
Environment</h2>
<p>As a precursor to the following process, it is assumed that the user
is familiar with Unreal Engine, Unreal Editor, or going to take time to
learn about these items from online resources. This process will not
fill in the knowledge gap on the basic operation of Unreal Application
development.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>(If applicable) Download and Install Unreal Engine.</li>
<li>(If applicable) Download and Build the appropriate package for the
corresponding Unreal Engine.</li>
<li>Follow the Airsim / Colosseum directions to build the Unreal Plugin
package.</li>
<li>Open Unreal Editor, Start a new project (user’s preference, but I’ve
typically built using the Simulation template.)</li>
<li>Using FAB (formerly Quixel Bridge / Unreal Marketplace), find a
desired environment package to use and install it to the project. (or
create / use any other environment as you see fit.).</li>
<li>In the folder structure for the new project, under /Plugins/, drop
in the Airsim Plugin folder built in step 3. This binary package should
be located under &lt;root&gt;/Unreal/Plugins/Airsim. (Note: it will be
labeled <code>Airsim</code> even in Colosseum.)</li>
<li>Change the “GameMode Override” under “WorldSettings” to
“AirsimGameMode”.</li>
<li>Add the asset package <code>BamBaseball</code> to the level; use the
directions to do so found here.</li>
<li>Build the package for the desired platform by going to
“Platforms-&gt;&lt;platform&gt;-&gt;Package Project” (using Windows as
an example). This step can take a while if the world hasn’t been built
or packaged before.</li>
