<h1 id="bamecho-airsim-json-examples">BamEcho: Airsim JSON Examples</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The files contained in this folder demonstrate some sample
configurations for Airsim as it is loaded up in an Unreal Environment.
The user will need to either leverage one of these examples or create
their own that will need to be readily available for Airsim when it is
run.</p>
<p>The JSON file can be made available to the Unreal Environment in a
few ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Place the file under ‘&lt;%UserProfile%&gt;/Documents/Airsim/’.
Airsim will naturally look here when starting up under Windows. For the
default location on other platforms, see the Airsim Documentation on
Settings:
https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/settings/#where-are-settings-stored</p></li>
<li><p>Place the file in the same directory as the binary for the Airsim
Unreal Environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the file in the same directory where the Airsim Unreal
Environment will be started up. Specifically, if a command or script
will launch the application in a different working directory than where
it actually resides; put the file there.</p></li>
<li><p>Pass the path to a specific JSON file in as a command line
argument for the Unreal Environment application. For example:
’AirSimEnvironment.exe
-settings=“&lt;%PathToSettings%&gt;.json”</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The Airsim settings file placed in directories as “default” locations
for Airsim to find will need to be named <em>settings.json</em>. Files
name otherwise, like the examples here, will not be found otherwise.</p>
<p>The Airsim documentation goes into more depth on the topic of
settings that can be configured, but for Echo’s purposes it might be
useful to focus on the following</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>CameraDefaults / CameraSettings</em> - The subgroupings in
this section will set the image resolution that Echo will receive when
capturing. Note also that the settings still use the index value for the
camera versus the name. (See Airsim Doc for indexing cross referencing,
https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/camera_views/)</p></li>
<li><p><em>DefaultSensors</em> - This lets the user activate whatever
instruments are available. This can be critical depending on the
CameraViews that Echo is trying to capture. For example, to get any of
the depth camera views to work, the “<em>Distance</em>” sensor needs to
be enabled. See the Airsim documentation for more information.</p></li>
<li><p><em>PhysicsEngineName</em> - This needs to be set to
“<em>ExternalPhysicsEngine</em>” to prevent Echo’s trajectory
transmission from fighting with Unreal’s internal physics, which can
produce some dizzying animations.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Vehicles</em> - This sets the instantiation information for
the Airsim environment’s actors. Echo needs at least one multirotor
vehicle named “Drone” to work.</p></li>
</ul>
